# Springboard Mini Project Portfolio

I completed a number of mini-projects as part of my Springboard data science coursework.  This repository contains all of the mini-projects that I completed in connection with that course and is meant to demonstrate the breadth of subject matter that I covered throughout the course's comprehensive data science curriculum.  Here is a complete list of the projects by topic:

-  [API/Python Mini-Project](https://github.com/gmj110680/springboard-mini-projects/blob/master/api_python_project_solutions.ipynb);
