# Springboard Mini-Project Portfolio

I completed a number of mini-projects as part of my Springboard data science coursework.  The mini-projects were designed as guided Jupyter notebooks with interactive exercises for the user to complete.

This repository contains a significant portion of the mini-projects that I completed throughout the Springboard course and is meant to demonstrate the breadth of subject matter that I covered during the course's comprehensive data science curriculum.  Here is a list of the projects by topic:
